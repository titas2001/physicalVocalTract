check how constant excitation works 

different shaped models (changing S to some functions instead of 1)
	start with triangle shape of smth simple	
	make different S functions to model shape of vocal tract
	
see to the 1/2 thing in equation 19.49 page 361 in tutorial

TODO
- Check some proper excitation functions
- Check shape functions
- look for proper damping
