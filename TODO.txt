TODO
- model of the excitation (we need Stefania for that maybe)
- Start modelling a correct shape function that models different vowels
- frequency dependent damping
- find correct values for damping coefficients
- model correct length of vocal tract-->we need to check for correct resonances
- Start changing spatial and temporal sampling: we probably need a lower h->sampling frequency change accordingly, then downsample for sound. Check paper "Characteristics of Two-Dimensional Finite Difference Techniques for Vocal Tract Analysis and Voice Synthesis"
- how do we evaluate the model? Literature review
