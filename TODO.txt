TODO
- model of the excitation (we need Stefania for that maybe) (F)
- Start modelling a correct shape function that models different vowels (T)
- frequency dependent damping (R)
- find correct values for damping coefficients (R)
- model correct length of vocal tract-->we need to check for correct resonances (T)
- Start changing spatial and temporal sampling: we probably need a lower h->sampling frequency change accordingly, then downsample for sound. Check paper "Characteristics of Two-Dimensional Finite Difference Techniques for Vocal Tract Analysis and Voice Synthesis"
- how do we evaluate the model? Literature review
- implement sound radiation at open end-->other boundary condition rather than Neumann or Dirichlet (R)
- time-varying profiles
- virtual grid points
- find right value for h, it's not the one we are using anymore(R)
- fix input with equation pg 270
